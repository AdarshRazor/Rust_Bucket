# Apify-like Web Scraping System

## Overview

This project aims to build a free, self-hosted system for web scraping and email extraction, similar in functionality to Apify. The system will leverage open-source tools and techniques to overcome common anti-bot measures.

## Content

The system will include the following features and components:

*   Core scraping engine with support for static and dynamic content.
*   Basic and advanced anti-blocking techniques (user-agent rotation, randomized delays, proxy management, headless browser integration, browser fingerprinting mitigation).
*   Data storage options (local files, open-source databases).
*   Task scheduler for automating scraping jobs.
*   Optional web interface for managing tasks and viewing data.

## Steps

The project will be developed in phases:

**Phase 1: Core Scraping Engine with Basic Anti-Blocking**

1.  Choose a programming language (Python recommended) and core libraries (requests, BeautifulSoup, Scrapy, Selenium/Playwright).
2.  Implement basic anti-blocking techniques (user-agent rotation, randomized delays, basic error handling).
3.  Integrate a robots.txt parser.
4.  Set up basic data storage (local files).

**Phase 2: Advanced Anti-Blocking & Automation Features**

1.  Implement proxy management, including fetching, validating, and rotating free public proxies.
2.  Integrate headless browsers (Puppeteer/Playwright) for dynamic content.
3.  Implement stealth techniques and browser fingerprinting mitigation.
4.  Implement session management.
5.  Explore basic CAPTCHA handling (with limitations for complex CAPTCHAs).

**Phase 3: System Architecture & User Interface (Optional)**

1.  Design a modular architecture.
2.  Implement a task scheduler.
3.  (Optional) Build a web interface for task management and data visualization.

## Todos

*   Research and select specific libraries for each component.
*   Set up a development environment.
*   Start implementing Phase 1 features.
*   Continuously test and refine anti-blocking techniques.
*   Explore different data storage options.
*   Consider ethical implications and legal compliance for web scraping.
