## Explanation 
There are several tools you can use to display that data:<br>1. The Azure portal: You can find a variety of tools by going to the Application Insights resource in the portal. These tools include a set of common performance charts on the Overview page, an Application map, and Performance and Failures pages. There's also an Application Insights dashboard that contains a common set of charts. You can use the Metrics page to design new charts and add them to dashboards.<br>2. Power BI: Business analysts often use this tool to investigate business values like sales and profit margins. You can connect Power BI to an Application Insights resource and use it to display web app telemetry data.<br>3. Visual Studio: Developers can connect Visual Studio to Application Insights to view the same charts and visualizations that are shown in the Azure portal. It's convenient to see code and performance data in one tool.<br>4. Custom tools: Application Insights includes a comprehensive API for accessing telemetry and analytics. Custom tools and applications can use the API to power their own visualizations. For example, if you have a custom mobile app that your business decision-makers use to view sales data, you can add a visualization of website performance statistics to the app.
