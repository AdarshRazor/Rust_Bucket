## Explanation
Dynamic Devices: (Security groups only) Apply dynamic group rules to automatically add and remove devices in security groups. When device attributes change, Azure reviews the dynamic group rules for the directory. If the device attributes meet the rule requirements, the device is added to the security group. If the device attributes no longer meet the rule requirements, the device is removed.
