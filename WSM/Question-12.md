## Explanation 
Azure AD helps you provide ‘access rights’ to a single user or to an entire group of users. You can assign a set of access permissions to all the members of the group. Access permissions range from full access to-the ability to create or remove resources.<br> There are different ways to assign ‘access rights’:<br>1. Direct assignment: Assign a user the required ‘access rights’ by directly assigning a role that has those ‘access rights’.<br>2. Group assignment: Assign a group the required access rights to be inherited by the members of the group.<br>3. Rule-based assignment: Use rules to determine a group membership based on user or device properties. For a user account or device's group membership to be valid, the user or device must meet the rules. If the rules aren't met, the user account or device's group membership is no longer valid. The rules can be simple. You can select prewritten rules or write your own advanced rules.
