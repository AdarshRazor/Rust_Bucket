## Explanation
Common reasons to migrate to a new AD DS forest include: <br>1.An acquisition or merger. Your organization is being acquired and you need to move users and computers to a new or existing forest.<br>2.Divesture of a company or business unit. Your organization is splitting, and you need to move users and computers to a separate forest. <br>3.Need to rename the AD forest or domain. Your organization has changed its name and wants the new name reflected in the AD DS forest.<br>4.Active Directory Domain Services compromised by a security event. Attackers have compromised Active Directory to such an extent that a fresh deployment is the only way to ensure they have not maintained persistence.<br>5.Aging Active Directory Domain Services forest that requires rationalization due to a buildup of legacy configuration alterations. Some AD DS instances have been used for more than two decades and modifications to the schema and security delegations have been imperfectly documented or forgotten. A new implementation allows an organization to start over from a fresh beginning.  Â
