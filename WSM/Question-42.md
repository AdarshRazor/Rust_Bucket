## Explanation 
Azure Arc-enabled servers can leverage a breadth of capabilities, so you can bring Azure services to your machines anywhere: across on-premises, multi-cloud, and edge environments. These capabilities serve diverse use cases across security, observability, and governance needs.<br><br>Azure Resource	Azure Arc-enabled servers benefit from Azure's robust resource management functions, including:<br>•	The ability to organize all organizational resources by using Azure management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, and tags.<br>•	A single, comprehensive inventory of organizational assets across multi-clouds and on-premises, including support for searching and indexing by using Azure Resource Graph.<br>•	A consolidated view of Azure and Azure Arc-enabled resources via the Azure portal, Azure Command Line Interface (CLI), Azure PowerShell, and Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API).<br><br>Microsoft Defender for Cloud	Microsoft Defender for Cloud enables customers to protect non-Azure servers with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (included through Microsoft Defender for Cloud) for threat detection, for vulnerability management, and to proactively monitor for potential security threats. Microsoft Defender for Cloud presents the alerts and remediation suggestions from the threats detected and consolidates security posture with a high-level security score.<br><br>Microsoft Sentinel	You can configure machines connected to Arc-enabled servers with Microsoft Sentinel to collect security-related events and correlate them with other data sources.<br><br>Azure Monitor	Monitor the connected machine guest operating system performance and discover application components to monitor their processes and dependencies with other resources using VM insights. Collect other log data, such as performance data and events, from the operating system or workload(s) running on the machine with the Log Analytics agent.<br><br>Azure Policy	Azure Policy enables customers to manage and evaluate their Arc-enabled servers' internal and regulatory compliance. Users can define, assign, and remediate based on Azure Policy guest configurations to audit settings inside the machine like their time zone or security vulnerabilities.<br><br>Azure Automation	Automate frequent and time-consuming management tasks using PowerShell and Python runbooks. Assess configuration changes about installed software, Microsoft services, Windows registry and files, and Linux daemons using Change Tracking and Inventory. Use Update Management to manage operating system updates for your Windows and Linux servers.<br><br>Azure Automanage	Automate onboarding and configuration of a set of Azure services when you use Automanage Machine for Azure Arc-enabled servers.<br><img src="https://github.com/CloudLabs-MOC-PT/Practice-Test-Images/blob/main/CLX/Images/E42.PNG?raw=true"/>
