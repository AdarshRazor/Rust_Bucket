## Explanation
Although Windows Server Migration Tools can also be used to migrate file shares, you should use the Storage Migration Service instead. Source servers must be running Windows Server 2008 or newer. However, you can't migrate from a server core installation of Windows Server that doesn't have the Microsoft .NET Framework. For example, Windows Server 2008 Server Core.
