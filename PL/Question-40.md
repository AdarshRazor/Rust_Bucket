The tourism provider has partners around the world that offer accommodation of all levels, day tours, weekend breaks, and custom experiences.

This has a tremendous amount of business logic built into it and the provider is not willing to replace it at present.<br>However, the SQL databases do not meet all their requirements for holding information and the provider is happy to look at other options.
