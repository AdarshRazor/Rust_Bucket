## Explanation
An Unmanaged Solution should be created. This will allow new components to be added and existing components within the solution to be modified. Unmanaged Solutions are created in development environments to allow components to be grouped and developers to update the components.<br>Managed Solutions do not allow updating of components.<br>An Environment is not a type of solution. Solutions are created within environments.<br>A Default Solution is created in each environment and contains many artifacts. New development should not take place in the Default Solution and a new Unmanaged Solution should be created instead.
