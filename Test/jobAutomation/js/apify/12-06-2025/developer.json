For details specific to your location, please consult with your recruiter.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe Roku Culture\n\n\nRoku is a great place for people who want to work in a fast-paced environment where everyone is focused on the company's success rather than their own. We try to surround ourselves with people who are great at their jobs, who are easy to work with, and who keep their egos in check. We appreciate a sense of humor. We believe a fewer number of very talented folks can do more for less cost than a larger number of less talented teams.

In short, at Roku you'll be part of a company that's changing how the world watches TV. \n\n\nWe have a unique culture that we are proud of. We think of ourselves primarily as problem-solvers, which itself is a two-part idea. We come up with the solution, but the solution isn't real until it is built and delivered to the customer. That penchant for action gives us a pragmatic approach to innovation, one that has served us well since 2002. \n\n\nTo learn more about Roku, our global footprint, and how we've grown, visit https://www.weareroku.com/factsheet.\n\n\nBy providing your information, you acknowledge that you have read our Applicant Privacy Notice and authorize Roku to process your data subject to those terms.",
