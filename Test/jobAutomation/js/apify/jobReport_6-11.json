Built on the world’s largest foundation of customer interactions and go-to-market team data, Outreach’s leading revenue AI technology helps go-to-market professionals and their companies win by intelligently accelerating decision making and elevating sellers to do their best work. Our powerful platform gives revenue teams the tools they need to design, measure, and improve a revenue strategy for every stage of the customer journey, improving efficiency and effectiveness across the entire revenue cycle. Over 6,000 customers, including Zoom, McKesson, Snowflake, SAP, and Okta use Outreach to power workflows, put customers at the center of their business, improve revenue results, and win in the market.\n\nOutreach is a privately held company based in Seattle, Washington, with offices worldwide. To learn more, please visit www.outreach.io.\n\nAbout The Team\n\nOn the Voice Service and Experience Team we:\n\n▪ Own features end-to-end, from the customer need all the way to the back-end implementation\n\n▪ Ship code to production every day\n\n▪ Are highly collaborative and foster a learning environment\n\n▪ Do Agile development, with Sprints and regular retrospectives\n\n▪ Function in a highly progressive, quick-iteration environment focused on delivering consistent, incremental customer value\n\n▪ Have something new to demo every week\n\nThe team’s mission is to continually reduce the time spent by customer-facing representatives on data access and modification across different systems. We provide customers with meaningful and relevant data aggregated at their fingertips, to increase the time they can invest in adding value for their customers.\n\nWe’re currently shoring up the core functionalities of our telecom product. In the long term we want to give customers the same edge with calling and messaging that they have with email: the ability to optimize and constantly improve how they interact with customers. We will face new challenges as we continue to scale out to ten times the volume of calling we have today and beyond. These efforts present a diverse gamut of work that will help enhance Outreach’s competitive edge by making our customers more effective.\n\nThe Role\n\nMaking and receiving voice calls are a key component of the Outreach product offering. Every month, Outreach customers complete more than 8 million calls with their prospects on our voice platform. The Voice Service and Experience Team is hiring software engineers to increase its momentum in this space. If you have experience building high availability voice communication experiences on top of open-source real-time communication software and commercial communications platform APIs, we’d love to talk to you about this opportunity.\n\nTelecom system development is a little different from other web development. The features we build are inherently heavy on state, complex in workflow, and include extensive third-party integrations. You’ll have to be creative, build on top of a lot of existing technology, and stay focused on Outreach’s core value proposition of revenue efficiency.
