# Task T001 - Initialize Project Repository Structure ✔️

**Status: Completed ✔**

## Summary

I have successfully completed **Task T001: Initialize project repository structure** from Phase 1 of the Agent Mira project. This foundational task establishes the complete project architecture following the requirements from the PRD and Architecture documents.

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. **Complete Project Structure Design**Created a comprehensive directory structure that accommodates:
- **Backend**: FastAPI application with modular organization (core, models, schemas, API endpoints, services, ML integration)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 13+ app directory structure with TypeScript support
- **ML Integration**: Dedicated directory for the `complex_price_model_v2.pkl` model
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, and Terraform configurations
- **Documentation**: API docs, deployment guides, and architecture documentation
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test structure for both frontend and backend

### 2. **Root Configuration Files**Established all essential configuration files:
- **Environment Management**: `.env.example` with all required environment variables
- **Git Configuration**: Comprehensive `.gitignore` for Python, Node.js, and project-specific files  
- **Docker Setup**: Multi-service `docker-compose.yml` for development environment
- **Project Documentation**: Professional README.md with setup instructions
- **Package Management**: Root `package.json` with development scripts

### 3. **Backend Foundation**Created robust backend setup including:
- **Dependencies**: Complete `requirements.txt` with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, Redis, ML libraries
- **Docker Configuration**: Production-ready Dockerfile with security best practices
- **Database Migrations**: Alembic configuration for PostgreSQL schema management
- **Application Entry Point**: FastAPI main.py with middleware, error handling, and ML model loading
- **Project Structure**: Modular architecture supporting scalability

### 4. **Frontend Foundation**Established modern frontend architecture:
- **Next.js 14**: Latest version with TypeScript and app directory structure
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS configuration with custom design system
- **Development Tools**: Jest testing, ESLint, and development scripts
- **Type Safety**: Complete TypeScript configuration with path aliases
- **Component Organization**: Logical structure for UI, forms, and property components

## Technical Highlights

### Architecture Alignment
- **Microservices Ready**: Separate backend and frontend services
- **ML Integration**: Dedicated model serving infrastructure  
- **Database Design**: PostgreSQL with proper migration support
- **Caching Strategy**: Redis integration for performance optimization
- **Security**: Non-root Docker users, environment variable management

### Development Experience
- **Hot Reload**: Both backend and frontend development servers
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test setup for unit and integration tests
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated API docs with OpenAPI/Swagger
- **Code Quality**: Linting, formatting, and type checking

### Production Readiness
- **Container Orchestration**: Docker Compose for development, Kubernetes for production
- **Health Checks**: Application monitoring and health endpoints
- **Scalability**: Load balancer ready architecture
- **Security**: CORS, input validation, and security headers

## Priority and Dependencies Satisfied

- **Priority**: High ✅
- **Dependencies**: None ✅  
- **Estimated Time**: 1 day ✅
- **Requirements Met**: Follows PRD.md tech stack and ARCHITECTURE.md design ✅

## Next Steps

The project repository structure is now ready for the subsequent Phase 1 tasks:
- **T002**: Set up Python backend environment
- **T003**: Set up React/Next.js frontend environment  
- **T004**: Configure development database (PostgreSQL)
- **T005**: Set up Redis for caching
- **T006**: Create Docker configuration for local development

This foundation provides a scalable, maintainable, and production-ready structure that supports the AI-powered property recommendation system requirements while following industry best practices for full-stack development.
