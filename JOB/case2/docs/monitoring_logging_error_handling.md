# Monitoring, Logging, and Error Handling Strategy

## 1. Monitoring
- **Backend (FastAPI):**
  - Integrate with Prometheus for metrics (via middleware or third-party packages).
  - Use Grafana for dashboarding and alerting.
  - Monitor key metrics: request count, latency, error rate, memory/CPU usage.
- **Frontend (Next.js):**
  - Use Vercel/Netlify analytics or Google Analytics for user activity.
  - Monitor API call failures and page load times.
- **Deployment:**
  - Use Docker healthchecks for container status.
  - Monitor container restarts and resource usage.

## 2. Logging
- **Backend:**
  - Use Python's `logging` module (already set up in FastAPI app).
  - Log all unhandled exceptions, warnings, and key events (startup, shutdown, API calls).
  - For production, forward logs to a centralized system (e.g., ELK stack, Loki, or cloud logging).
- **Frontend:**
  - Log API errors and user actions to the browser console (for dev).
  - For production, use a service like Sentry for error tracking.

## 3. Error Handling
- **Backend:**
  - Use FastAPI exception handlers (already implemented for generic errors).
  - Return clear, user-friendly error messages (avoid leaking stack traces).
  - Validate all incoming data and handle model/data loading errors gracefully.
- **Frontend:**
  - Show user-friendly error messages for failed API calls (already implemented).
  - Handle form validation errors before submission.
  - Provide loading indicators and fallback UI for network issues.

## 4. Best Practices
- Use environment variables for all secrets and sensitive config.
- Restrict CORS in production.
- Regularly review logs and metrics for anomalies.
- Set up alerts for high error rates or downtime.
