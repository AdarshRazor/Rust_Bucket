Of course. This is an ambitious and deeply inspiring project. Building a personalized AI like JARVIS is the dream of many, and your vision for ARIA is well-defined and thoughtful. It touches upon the very cutting edge of what AI agents are becoming. Let's break this down into a structured, actionable plan.

First, I will provide the **Product Requirements Document (PRD)** you requested. This will solidify the vision and core features. Then, I will create a detailed **Project Plan (TODO List)** with phases, tasks, priorities, and dependencies to guide your development journey.

***

### Part 1: Product Requirements Document (PRD) - ARIA

**1. Vision & Mission**
*   **Product:** ARIA (A Random Intelligent Assistant)
*   **Vision:** To create a deeply personalized, adaptive AI companion that acts as a trusted partner, helping users achieve their full potential through continuous learning, proactive support, and seamless data integration.
*   **Mission:** ARIA's mission is to be a non-judgmental confidant and an intelligent assistant that understands the user on a fundamental level. It will manage tasks, centralize data, and provide insights into the user's emotional and physical well-being, all while evolving alongside the user.

**2. Target User**
*   Initially, the primary user is the developer (you).
*   In the future, this can be extended to individuals who are focused on self-improvement, productivity, and desire a single, trusted AI to manage their digital life and provide emotional support.

**3. Core Features (The Pillars of ARIA)**

| Feature Pillar | Description | Key Components |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pillar 1: Conversational & Context Engine** | The foundation of interaction. ARIA must understand, remember, and respond to conversations naturally and empathetically. | - **LLM Integration:** Pluggable interface for models like GPT-4, Llama 3, etc.<br>- **Short-Term Memory:** Maintain context within a single conversation.<br>- **Prompt Engineering:** System prompts designed for an empathetic, supportive, and curious persona. |
| **Pillar 2: Personalized Knowledge Graph & Long-Term Memory** | ARIA's "brain." This moves beyond simple chat history to a structured understanding of the user's world, values, and emotions. | - **Entity Extraction:** Identify people, places, dates, tasks, and concepts from conversations.<br>- **Associative Memory (Tags & Embeddings):** Store conversation summaries (tags, keywords, emotional valence) in a vector database for semantic recall. A user mentioning "divorce" would retrieve memories tagged with related concepts (e.g., sadness, a specific person's name).<br>- **Structured Knowledge Base:** A graph database or relational DB to store hard facts (e.g., `(User) -> [has_birthday_on] -> (Date)`, `(Mom) -> [is_a] -> (Family)`). |
| **Pillar 3: Priority & Task Management Engine** | The "doer." This agentic component allows ARIA to take action, manage tasks intelligently, and optimize its own workflow. | - **Priority Scale (1-10):** A system to score all incoming information (tasks, conversations, suggestions). Learned over time via user feedback.<br>- **Intent Recognition:** Classify user input as a `command`, `query`, `chat`, or `memory_storage`.<br>- **Task Queue:** A prioritized list of actions to be taken.<br>- **Task Grouper/Optimizer:** An agent that reviews the queue and groups similar tasks (e.g., run all web searches at once) to improve efficiency. |
| **Pillar 4: Proactive Intelligence & Well-being Monitor** | This transforms ARIA from a reactive assistant to a proactive companion. | - **Data Integrations:** APIs to connect to calendars, smartwatches (heart rate, sleep), screen time apps, notifications, etc.<br>- **Pattern Recognition:** Identify deviations from the norm (e.g., unusually high heart rate during a work meeting, excessive social media use late at night).<br>- **Suggestion Engine:** Based on patterns and the Priority Scale, ARIA will decide *when* and *how* to engage. A critical health alert is immediate; a productivity suggestion can wait for a daily summary. |
| **Pillar 5: Centralized Data & Tool Use** | ARIA as the single access point to the user's digital world. | - **Toolbox:** A set of functions ARIA can use (e.g., `web_search`, `read_calendar`, `check_email`, `file_organizer`).<br>- **Secure Data Vault:** A designated, encrypted location on the user's machine (or private server) where ARIA stores retrieved data, files, and summaries.<br>- **API-Driven Architecture:** The core logic runs as a local server, allowing different frontends (CLI, phone app, web app) to connect to it. |

**4. Technical Architecture (Initial Phase)**

*   **Language/Framework:** Python (for its robust AI/ML ecosystem). A FastAPI server to expose ARIA's logic via a REST API.
*   **LLM:** Start with the OpenAI API (e.g., `gpt-4o`) for its power and ease of use. Plan for future integration with local models via Ollama (e.g., Llama 3, Mistral) for privacy.
*   **Long-Term Memory:** A local vector database like **ChromaDB** or **FAISS** is perfect for storing and searching conversation embeddings and tags.
*   **Structured Knowledge:** **SQLite** is sufficient for the initial phase to store structured data like birthdays, contacts, and task lists. Can be upgraded to a graph database like **Neo4j** later for complex relationships.
*   **Frontend:** Start with a simple Command Line Interface (CLI). Later, use your MERN skills to build a web interface that communicates with the Python FastAPI backend.
*   **Hosting:** Local machine. A Raspberry Pi 4/5 is an excellent, low-power choice for a dedicated 24/7 server.

**5. User Experience Flow (Example)**

1.  **User:** "Ugh, so stressed about the project deadline this Friday. Also, I need to remember to get a gift for Sarah's birthday next week."
2.  **ARIA (Internal Process):**
    *   **Intent Recognition:** Detects `memory_storage` (stress about project) and a `command` (remember birthday).
    *   **Entity Extraction:** Extracts `Project Deadline (this Friday)`, `Stress (emotion)`, `Sarah (person)`, `Birthday (event)`.
    *   **Task Management:** Creates a high-priority task: `Find project details and offer help`. Creates a medium-priority task: `Add "Buy gift for Sarah" to todo list for next week`.
    *   **Long-Term Memory:** Creates a vector embedding for "user feels stress related to project deadlines" and stores it with tags `[work, project, stress]`. Checks its knowledge base for "Sarah"; if she doesn't exist, it might ask, "Who is Sarah? I'll add her to your important contacts."
3.  **ARIA (Response):** "I've noted that you're stressed about your project deadline on Friday. I can look up the project files for you if you'd like. I've also added a reminder to get a gift for Sarah's birthday next week. Don't worry, we'll manage it together."

### Part 2: Project Plan & TODO List

Here is a phased approach to building ARIA from the ground up. Each phase builds upon the last, ensuring you have a working prototype at every stage.

| Task ID | Task Description | Phase | Priority | Status | Dependencies |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 0: Foundation & Setup** |
| T01 | Setup Python environment (`venv`), install initial libraries (`openai`, `rich` for nice CLI). | 0 | **Critical** | Not Started | - |
| T02 | Get an OpenAI API key. Create a `config.py` file to store it securely. | 0 | **Critical** | Not Started | - |

| **Phase 1: The Core Conversational Loop (MVP)** |
| T04 | Create a `main.py` script with a simple `while` loop for a Command Line Interface (CLI). | 1 | **Critical** | Not Started | T01 |
| T05 | Write a function `get_llm_response(prompt)` that sends a user's input to the OpenAI API and prints the reply. | 1 | **Critical** | Not Started | T02, T04 |
| T06 | Implement basic short-term memory by passing the last few messages back to the API in the `messages` array. | 1 | High | Not Started | T05 |
| T07 | Create a System Prompt that defines ARIA's personality (empathetic, helpful, a bit like JARVIS). | 1 | Medium | Not Started | T05 |
| **Phase 2: Introducing Long-Term Memory** |
| T08 | Install and set up a local vector database (`pip install chromadb`). | 2 | **Critical** | Not Started | T01 |
| T09 | After each response, create a new LLM call to summarize the conversation into key facts and tags. (e.g., "User is learning Python. User's dog is named Max.") | 2 | **Critical** | Not Started | T06 |
| T10 | Store these summaries as vector embeddings in ChromaDB. | 2 | **Critical** | Not Started | T08, T09 |
| T11 | Before sending a new prompt to the LLM, perform a similarity search on ChromaDB with the user's input to find relevant memories. | 2 | **Critical** | Not Started | T10 |
| T12 | Inject the retrieved memories into the system prompt as context. ("Note: Remember that the user's dog is named Max."). | 2 | High | Not Started | T11 |
| T13 | Set up a simple SQLite database (`main.db`) to store explicit facts like birthdays and contact relationships. | 2 | Medium | Not Started | T01 |
| **Phase 3: The Agentic Brain - Task Management** |
| T14 | Design the intent recognition system. Create a function that uses the LLM to classify user input into categories: `chat`, `command`, `question`. | 3 | **Critical** | Not Started | T05 |
| T15 | Implement a `task_queue` in the SQLite DB with columns: `id`, `description`, `priority`, `status`, `created_at`. | 3 | **Critical** | Not Started | T13 |
| T16 | When a `command` intent is detected, use the LLM to formulate a task and its priority (1-10) and add it to the queue. | 3 | High | Not Started | T14, T15 |
| T17 | Build the first "Tool": a function `tool_web_search(query)`. You can use a library like `duckduckgo-search`. | 3 | High | Not Started | T01 |
| T18 | Create an "Orchestrator" loop that periodically checks the task queue, selects the highest priority task, and executes it using the correct tool. | 3 | High | Not Started | T15, T17 |
| T19 | Implement the Task Grouping logic in the Orchestrator. (e.g., if multiple `web_search` tasks are in the queue, run them in one batch). | 3 | Medium | Not Started | T18 |
| **Phase 4: Data Integration & Proactivity** |
| T20 | Start with a simple data integration: Write a function to read a local `.ics` calendar file. | 4 | **Critical** | Not Started | T01 |
| T21 | Create a daily "Good Morning" routine that ARIA runs automatically, summarizing calendar events and high-priority tasks for the day. | 4 | High | Not Started | T15, T20 |
| T22 | [Advanced] Research and attempt to connect to a service API like Google Calendar or Apple Health (requires OAuth and handling user permissions). | 4 | Low | Not Started | T21 |
| T23 | Implement rule-based proactivity. (e.g., `IF event_name CONTAINS 'birthday' AND event_date IS_IN 7_days THEN create_task('Buy gift')`). | 4 | Medium | Not Started | T16, T21 |
| **Phase 5: Scaling & UX** |
| T24 | Refactor the core logic into a FastAPI backend. Create endpoints like `/chat`, `/tasks`, `/memory`. | 5 | High | Not Started | T18, T12 |
| T25 | Use your MERN skills to build a simple web-based frontend that calls the FastAPI backend. | 5 | High | Not Started | T24 |
| T26 | Integrate a Text-to-Speech (TTS) library (e.g., `pyttsx3` for local, or an online API) and a Speech-to-Text (STT) library (`whisper`). | 5 | Medium | Not Started | T24 |
| T27 | Deploy the FastAPI backend on a Raspberry Pi or a small cloud server. | 5 | Medium | Not Started | T24 |

This roadmap breaks down your grand vision into manageable, motivating steps. Start with Phase 0 and 1. Getting that first conversational loop working will be a huge confidence booster. Then, layer on the more advanced concepts one by one. Good luck, this is a fantastic project. I am here to help you with code snippets or conceptual explanations at any step of this journey.
