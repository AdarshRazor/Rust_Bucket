Of course. This is a fantastic and ambitious project. Building a personalized AI like JARVIS is the holy grail for many developers, and your vision for ARIA is well-defined and deeply personal. I will guide you through this process, focusing on a scalable architecture and a phased approach that allows you to build and see results incrementally.

First, let's acknowledge that this is a long-term project. We will break it down into manageable phases, starting with a strong foundation you can run on your local machine.

### High-Level Architectural Approach: The Brain of ARIA

Before diving into the PRD, let's establish the core architecture. Think of ARIA not as a single program, but as a system of components that work together, much like a brain.

1.  **The Orchestrator (The Frontal Lobe):** This is the central logic of your application. It receives input from you, decides what to do with it, and routes it to the appropriate module. It's the main Python script that runs the show. Frameworks like **LangChain** or **LlamaIndex** are perfect for this role, as they are designed to "chain" together different AI components.

2.  **The Language Model (The Reasoning Core):** This is the AI model that provides the "thinking" and "language" capabilities. It understands your text, generates responses, and can follow instructions.
    *   **To start:** We'll use a powerful API-based model like **OpenAI's GPT-4o** or **Anthropic's Claude 3 Opus**. This gives you state-of-the-art reasoning without the complexity of hosting a model.
    *   **Long-term goal:** We will plan to transition to a high-performance, open-source model like **Meta's Llama 3** or **Mixtral** that you can run locally (on your machine or a dedicated Raspberry Pi/server) for ultimate privacy and control.

3.  **The Memory System (The Hippocampus & Neocortex):** This is the most critical part of making ARIA truly personal. Your idea about "tags and labels" is brilliant and aligns perfectly with a concept called **Vector Embeddings**. We'll use a dual-memory system:
    *   **Long-Term Associative Memory (Vector Database):** When you say something to ARIA, we will convert that text into a numerical representation (an embedding/vector). This vector captures the *semantic meaning* of the text. We'll store these vectors in a **Vector Database** (e.g., **ChromaDB** for local start, later maybe Pinecone). When you ask a new question, we convert *that* question into a vector and search the database for the most similar vectors. This is how ARIA will "remember" related past conversations without storing everything verbatim, exactly as you envisioned.
    *   **Structured Memory (SQL/NoSQL Database):** For facts, tasks, and preferences. Things like "My birthday is on August 10th" or "Task: Write blog post, Priority: 7". A simple **SQLite** database is perfect to start with.

4.  **The Tool Belt (The Hands):** ARIA needs to *do* things. This is accomplished through "tools" or "agents." A tool is simply a function that the Orchestrator can call. Examples: `search_internet()`, `read_calendar()`, `add_task_to_db()`, `get_smart_watch_data()`. You will write these functions in Python.

Here is a diagram of this high-level architecture:


Now, let's formalize this into the documents you requested.

### Project Requirements Document (PRD): ARIA

**1. Introduction & Vision**
ARIA (A Random Intelligent Assistant) is a hyper-personalized, private AI companion designed to be a trusted lifelong partner. Its purpose is to understand its user on a deep level, assisting in daily tasks, monitoring well-being, and helping the user achieve their personal growth goals. Unlike general-purpose assistants, ARIA is built on a foundation of privacy, continuous learning, and proactivity, all centered around a single user.

**2. User Persona**
*   **Primary User:** An individual seeking a judgment-free digital confidant for emotional reliance and self-improvement.
*   **Technical Comfort:** Comfortable with technology and willing to grant access to personal data sources (phone, calendar, health apps) in exchange for deep personalization and proactive assistance.

**3. Core Features**

| Feature ID | Feature Name                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | User Story                                                                                                                     |
| :--------- | :----------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| F-01       | Contextual Conversation Engine       | ARIA can hold intelligent, context-aware conversations. It differentiates between commands, questions, and general discussion. It remembers the last few exchanges to maintain conversational flow.                                                                                    | "As a user, I want to talk to ARIA naturally, so that I don't have to repeat myself and the conversation feels fluid."            |
| F-02       | Long-Term Associative Memory         | Utilizes vector embeddings to store the semantic essence of conversations, ideas, and facts. Allows ARIA to recall related "memories" from the past when new, relevant topics arise, mirroring the user's "tags and labels" concept.                                               | "As a user, I want ARIA to remember what we've talked about in the past, so it understands the full context of my life."         |
| F-03       | Dynamic Task Management & Prioritization | ARIA can create, manage, and prioritize tasks. It uses a user-defined **Priority Scale (1-10)** to order tasks and can intelligently group similar sub-tasks (e.g., batching all web searches for a project) to optimize execution.                                            | "As a user, I want to tell ARIA my to-do list and have it intelligently prioritize and organize it for me."                    |
| F-04       | Proactive Intelligence & Suggestion  | ARIA can provide suggestions based on its observations. The delivery of these suggestions is governed by an **Intensity Scale**. High-intensity, critical alerts are delivered immediately, while low-intensity ideas are queued for a daily summary.                                | "As a user, I want ARIA to notify me about important things but not interrupt me with trivial suggestions."                     |
| F-05       | User Profile & Personalization       | ARIA maintains a structured profile of the user, including key dates (birthdays, anniversaries), preferences, goals, and personality insights (e.g., introvert/extrovert). This profile is continuously updated through interactions.                                                  | "As a user, I want ARIA to know me personally and remember the things that are important to me."                                  |
| F-06       | Data Integration & Tool Use          | ARIA can connect to and utilize external data sources and services via a "tool belt" of APIs and scripts. Initial tools will include web search, file system access, and calendar reading.                                                                                            | "As a user, I want ARIA to be able to access my calendar or search the web to help me with my tasks."                             |

**4. Non-Goals (For Initial Version)**
*   A graphical user interface (GUI). The initial interface will be a command-line interface (CLI).
*   Voice-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities. This will be added in a later phase.
*   Multi-user support. ARIA is designed for a single user.
*   Cloud deployment. The entire system will run locally first.
*   The "Project Metaverse" virtual world.

**5. Proposed Tech Stack & Rationale**

| Component                 | Technology Recommendation              | Rationale                                                                                                                                |
| :------------------------ | :------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Backend Language**      | Python 3.10+                           | The lingua franca of AI/ML. Unmatched library support for everything we need.                                                             |
| **AI Orchestration**      | **LangChain** or **LlamaIndex**        | Provides the essential framework for agents, memory, and tool usage. Drastically reduces boilerplate code. We'll start with LangChain.     |
| **LLM (Initial)**         | **OpenAI API (GPT-4o)**                | Easiest way to access state-of-the-art reasoning power without hardware overhead. Perfect for prototyping the logic.                       |
| **LLM (Long-Term)**       | **Ollama** with **Llama 3** / **Mixtral** | For local hosting. Ollama makes running open-source LLMs incredibly simple. This aligns with the long-term goal of privacy and control.   |
| **Vector Database**       | **ChromaDB**                           | Open-source, runs locally, and integrates seamlessly with LangChain. Perfect for building the long-term associative memory.                  |
| **Structured Database**   | **SQLite**                             | A simple, file-based SQL database included with Python. Sufficient for storing tasks, user profiles, and structured data.                   |
| **Frontend (Initial)**    | Command-Line Interface (CLI)           | Simplest possible user interface to focus on building the core backend logic first.                                                      |
| **Frontend (Future)**     | **Electron + React**                   | Since you are a MERN developer, this stack is a natural fit for building a cross-platform desktop app for ARIA later on.                 |
