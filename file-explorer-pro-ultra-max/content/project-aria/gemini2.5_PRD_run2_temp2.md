Of course. This is an ambitious and deeply inspiring project. Building a personalized AI like JARVIS, which you've named ARIA, is a fantastic goal. It touches on the very cutting edge of AI agent architecture, personalization, and human-computer interaction. I will guide you through this by breaking down your vision into a structured, technical, and architectural plan.

First, let's acknowledge your background. As a MERN developer, you are excellent at building user interfaces and handling data flow with APIs. We will leverage that. The Python/AI part is where I will provide detailed conceptual and practical guidance.

Let's start with the first document you requested.

## Product Requirements Document (PRD): ARIA

### 1. Introduction & Vision

**Project Name:** ARIA (A Random Intelligent Assistant)

**Vision:** To create a hyper-personalized AI companion that serves as a trusted, lifelong partner for self-improvement. ARIA will understand the user on a deep, emotional level, learn from their data and interactions, and proactively assist them in achieving their personal and professional goals, ultimately helping them become the best version of themselves.

### 2. Core Pillars & Features

This project can be broken down into four core pillars that define its functionality.

#### **Pillar 1: The Core Orchestration Engine**
This is the "brain" of ARIA, responsible for understanding, reasoning, and planning.

*   **F1.1: Contextual Natural Language Understanding (NLU):** ARIA must parse complex commands and conversational text to determine intent, entities (people, places, dates), and underlying meaning.
*   **F1.2: Agentic Task Delegation:** ARIA will not be one single AI model. It will be an orchestrator of smaller, specialized "agents." For example, a `WebSearchAgent`, a `CalendarAgent`, a `MemoryAgent`, and a `UserNotificationAgent`. The core engine decides which agent (or combination of agents) is needed for a task.
*   **F1.3: The Priority Scale:** A core system for ranking all incoming data, tasks, and potential outputs on a scale (e.g., 1-10).
    *   **Inputs to Priority:** Explicit commands ("this is important"), keywords ("urgent," "reminder"), inferred importance from user behavior (e.g., repeated questions about a topic), and the source of the data (a calendar notification for a meeting is higher priority than a social media notification).
    *   **Function:** This scale dictates task execution order, resource allocation (e.g., complex, low-priority tasks are run during off-peak hours), and the urgency of notifications.

#### **Pillar 2: The Adaptive Memory System**
This is where true personalization happens. ARIA must remember and learn, mimicking the associative nature of the human brain.

*   **F2.1: Long-Term Conversational Memory:** Storing summaries and key takeaways from conversations. This prevents ARIA from being stateless.
*   **F2.2: Neural Tagging & Association:** This is the technical implementation of your "human brain" idea.
    *   **How it works:** Every piece of information (a chat message, a task, a note) is converted into a vector embedding (a list of numbers that represents its meaning). These vectors are stored in a **Vector Database**.
    *   **Associative Recall:** When the user mentions a topic, ARIA converts that into a vector and searches the database for the most similar vectors. This is how it "recalls" related past conversations, emotions, and concepts without needing to store every word verbatim.
    *   **Metadata:** Alongside the vector, we store metadata "tags" or "labels" as you described: `[topic: "Project-X", emotion: "happy", priority_discussed: 7, date: "2024-10-27"]`. This allows for both semantic (meaning-based) and filtered search.
*   **F2.3: User Profile Synthesis:** ARIA will continuously build a dynamic profile of the user. This is not a static form but a living document containing:
    *   Preferences (e.g., communication style: formal/informal).
    *   Key Relationships (e.g., names of family members).
    *   Goals (e.g., "learn piano," "reduce screen time").
    *   Personality Traits (inferred over time, e.g., introvert/extrovert).

#### **Pillar 3: The Data Ingestion & Integration Layer**
ARIA is only as good as the data it has access to.

*   **F3.1: Data Connectors:** APIs and services to securely pull data from:
    *   **Personal Information Management:** Google Calendar, Outlook, Todoist.
    *   **Health & Wellness:** Smartwatch data (heart rate, sleep patterns) via Apple HealthKit or Google Fit APIs.
    *   **Device Usage:** Screen time APIs on macOS/Windows, and eventually Android/iOS.
    *   **Communication:** Email, notifications (with user permission).
*   **F3.2: Secure Data Storage:** All ingested data must be stored securely and locally on the user's machine (or a personal server like a Raspberry Pi) to uphold the promise of privacy and trust.

#### **Pillar 4: The Interaction & Proactive Engagement Layer**
This is how the user interacts with ARIA and how ARIA interacts back.

*   **F4.1: Multi-Modal Interface:**
    *   **Initial:** Text-based command line or simple desktop app.
    *   **Future:** Speech-to-text and text-to-speech for voice conversations.
*   **F4.2: Proactive Nudging:** Based on the data it analyzes, ARIA will initiate conversations.
    *   *Example:* "I noticed your screen time on social media was up 50% this week, and your calendar looks free. Would you like me to suggest some articles on your goal of learning Python?"
    *   *Example:* "Your heart rate has been elevated for the last hour, and you haven't moved. Everything okay? Maybe a short walk would help clear your head."
*   **F4.3: Suggestion Intensity Filter:** When ARIA has a suggestion, it uses the Priority Scale. A high-priority suggestion (e.g., "You have a meeting in 5 minutes!") triggers an immediate notification. A low-priority one ("Here's a cool article about a topic you liked last week") is stored in a queue to be delivered when the user is not busy.

### 3. High-Level System Architecture

A robust architecture will separate concerns, which is perfect for future scaling.

1.  **Frontend:** A simple desktop app built with **Electron** (since you know MERN, this uses web technologies like React). This is where the user types or talks.
2.  **Backend API Server (Node.js/Express):** Your MERN skills fit perfectly here. This server handles requests from the Frontend, manages user authentication (if any), and acts as a lightweight orchestrator. Its main job is to pass the user's request to the AI Core.
3.  **AI Core (Python):** This is the heart of ARIA. It runs as a separate service. The Node.js server communicates with it via a REST API. It contains:
    *   **LLM (Large Language Model):** The base model for understanding and generation. You can start with an API like OpenAI's GPT-4/GPT-4o or a powerful local model like Llama 3.
    *   **Agent Framework (LangChain or LlamaIndex):** A Python library that makes it easy to build the agentic system (F1.2) and connect the LLM to the Memory System and external tools.
    *   **The Priority Scale Logic:** A module that evaluates and assigns priority scores.
4.  **Data Layer:**
    *   **Vector Database (ChromaDB or FAISS):** For the Adaptive Memory System (F2.2). ChromaDB is great because it's easy to set up locally.
    *   **Relational Database (SQLite or PostgreSQL):** For structured data like user profiles, tasks, and logs. SQLite is file-based and perfect for a local-first application.
    *   **File Storage:** A designated local folder for documents and other unstructured data ARIA needs to manage.

Here is a simplified architectural diagram:

This roadmap is a living document. As you build, you'll discover new challenges and ideas. The key is to start with Phase 1 and build a solid foundation. Your vision is not just a project; it's a journey. Good luck, and feel free to ask for clarification on any of these steps.
