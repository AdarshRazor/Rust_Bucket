Of course. Let's synthesize these excellent ideas into a single, cohesive master plan. By combining the strategic vision, the architectural patterns, and the specific feature ideas you liked, we can create a definitive Product Requirements Document (PRD) and Project Plan that will serve as the master blueprint for ARIA.

This document is structured to be your guide from the first line of code to a deployed, personalized AI companion.

***

### **Part 1: Product Requirements Document (PRD) - ARIA**

**1. Vision & Mission**

*   **Product:** ARIA (A Random Intelligent Assistant)
*   **Vision:** To create a deeply personalized, private, and proactive AI companion. ARIA will serve as a trusted partner that understands the user on a fundamental level, helping them manage their digital life, achieve their goals, and enhance their well-being.
*   **Mission:** ARIA's mission is to be an agentic orchestrator for the user's life. It will centralize data, manage tasks with intelligent prioritization, recall context from an adaptive memory, and offer emotional insight, all while evolving alongside the user on their own hardware.

**2. Target User**

*   **Phase 1 (The Developer):** You. The initial focus is on building a tool that serves your specific needs.
*   **Phase 2 (The Power User):** Individuals focused on self-improvement, productivity, and life-logging who desire a single, private, and powerful AI to manage their digital ecosystem.

**3. Core Features (The Pillars of ARIA)**

This architecture is built on five interconnected pillars:

| Feature Pillar | Description | Key Components & Examples |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Pillar 1: Agentic Orchestrator Engine** | ARIA is not a monolithic AI; it's a "brain" that directs specialized sub-agents. It receives all inputs, determines intent, and delegates tasks to the appropriate tool. | - **LLM-Powered Reasoning:** The core orchestrator uses a powerful LLM to parse input and decide the next action.<br>- **Intent Recognition:** Classifies input: `command`, `query`, `chat`, `memory_store`.<br>- **Agent Delegation:** Routes tasks to specialized agents like `WebSearchAgent`, `CalendarAgent`, or `MemoryAgent`. |
| **Pillar 2: Adaptive Memory & Knowledge Graph** | ARIA's brain, combining associative recall with structured facts. This allows ARIA to understand not just *what* was said, but *what it meant* in the broader context of the user's life. | - **Associative Memory (Vector DB):** Uses embeddings to store conversation summaries with metadata tags (`[topic: project_x, emotion: stress]`). Enables semantic search to recall related memories.<br>- **Structured Knowledge Graph (Relational DB):** Stores hard facts for immediate recall. Example: `(User) -> [has_birthday_on] -> (Date)`, `(Mom) -> [is_a] -> (Family)`. |
| **Pillar 3: Priority & Task Management Engine** | The "doer." ARIA intelligently prioritizes tasks, from simple reminders to complex multi-step projects, and optimizes its own workflow. | - **Priority Scale (1-10):** A learned system to score all incoming information and tasks, dictating execution order.<br>- **Task Queue:** A list of actions in a simple SQLite database, managed by the Orchestrator.<br>- **Task Optimizer:** A meta-agent that reviews the queue to group similar tasks (e.g., run all web searches at once). |
| **Pillar 4: Proactive Intelligence & Emotional Insight** | Transforms ARIA from a reactive tool to a proactive companion that understands the user's well-being. | - **Data Integrations:** APIs to connect to calendars, smartwatches (heart rate, sleep), screen time apps, etc.<br>- **Pattern Recognition:** Identifies deviations from baseline behavior (e.g., high stress & poor sleep before a deadline).<br>- **Suggestion Engine:** Based on patterns, it decides *when* and *how* to engage. A critical health alert is immediate; a productivity tip waits for a daily summary. |
| **Pillar 5: Voice & Multi-Modal Interaction** | The future evolution of ARIA, moving beyond text to become a fully immersive voice-enabled companion. | - **Speech-to-Text (STT):** Transcribes user's voice into text for the Orchestrator (e.g., via Whisper).<br>- **Text-to-Speech (TTS):** Converts ARIA's text responses into natural-sounding audio (e.g., via ElevenLabs or OpenAI TTS).<br>- **Multi-platform Access:** The core logic runs as a server, accessible via CLI, a desktop app, or eventually a mobile app. |

**4. Technical Architecture & Stack**

This architecture is designed for a local-first, privacy-centric approach, with the ability to scale.

*   **Deployment:** Start on **local machine** -> Migrate to a dedicated **Raspberry Pi 4/5** for 24/7, low-power operation.
*   **Architecture Diagram:**

| Component | Initial Choice (For Rapid Prototyping) | Long-Term Choice (For Privacy & Scale) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Language/Framework** | Python 3.10+ with FastAPI | Same |
| **LLM Provider** | **OpenAI API (`gpt-4o`)** | **Ollama (`llama3`, `mistral`, etc.)** |
| **Orchestration** | LangChain or LlamaIndex | Same |
| **Associative Memory** | ChromaDB (local) | ChromaDB or a more robust self-hosted option |
| **Structured Memory**| SQLite | PostgreSQL (if complexity grows) |
| **Frontend** | Command Line Interface (CLI) | MERN/Electron Desktop App, React Native Mobile App |
