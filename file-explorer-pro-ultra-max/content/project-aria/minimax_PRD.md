## 2. User Stories

1. As a user, I want ARIA to remember my important dates so it can send personalized greetings
2. As a user, I want ARIA to learn my productivity patterns to suggest better workflows
3. As a user, I want ARIA to detect when I'm stressed and suggest relaxation techniques
4. As a user, I want to control connected devices through natural language commands
5. As a user, I want ARIA to maintain privacy of my personal data

## 3. Technical Requirements

### 3.1 Architecture
- **Local Server**: Raspberry Pi 4/5 or equivalent
- **Data Storage**:
  - SQL Database (user preferences, tasks)
  - NoSQL Database (interaction history, unstructured data)
  - Encrypted local storage

### 3.2 Core Technologies
- **NLP Engine**: spaCy + custom transformers
- **Machine Learning**: 
  - PyTorch/TensorFlow for model training
  - ONNX runtime for optimized inference
- **Voice Processing**: Mozilla DeepSpeech/Matchbox

### 3.3 Data Pipeline
