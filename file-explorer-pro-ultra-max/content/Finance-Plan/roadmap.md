# Project Roadmap & Tech Stack - Finance Analysis Tool

## Point 1: Project Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation & Prototype
- Collect public financial data of a company (last 5–10 years).
- Analyze the data using Python (Pandas, NumPy).
- Build a simple predictive model (e.g., linear regression, time series forecasting).
- Create a basic dashboard or report showing trends and patterns.
- Showcase your work on GitHub or a portfolio site.

### Phase 2: Advanced Automation & Real-Time Analysis
- Integrate Natural Language Processing (NLP) for user input understanding.
- Fetch real-time market data using APIs (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage).
- Simulate and predict based on user plans and market conditions.
- Develop a user-friendly interface for seamless experience.
- Optimize the model for faster and more accurate predictions.

### Phase 3: Optimization & Deployment
- Make the user interface smoother and more intuitive.
- Integrate user feedback to refine the model.
- Performance tuning and make the project deployment-ready.
- Finalize the product for real-world use.

## Steps & Workflow

1. **Data Collection**
   - Gather real-time and historical financial data for the target company and key competitors using APIs (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage).
   - Collect relevant industry benchmarks.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Clean and normalize data using Pandas/NumPy.
   - Align timeframes and metrics for fair comparison.

3. **Comparative Analysis**
   - Use statistical methods to compare key financial ratios (P/E, EPS, ROE, etc.).
   - Visualize trends and differences using Matplotlib/Plotly.

4. **Predictive Modeling**
   - Build models (Scikit-learn, Statsmodels) to forecast future positions for both the target and competitors.
   - Use time series or regression models for prediction.

5. **Result Interpretation**
   - Highlight gaps and opportunities.
   - Suggest strategic moves based on predictive insights.

6. **Reporting & Dashboard**
   - Create a comparative dashboard (Streamlit/Dash) showing:
     - Current vs. predicted position
     - Peer ranking
     - Visual insights
