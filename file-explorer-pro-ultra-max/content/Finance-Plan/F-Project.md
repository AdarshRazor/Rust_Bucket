# Finance-Plan Project Overview

I want to create a project that helps users analyze a company's financial health, predict its future value, and provide strategic insights based on historical and real-time data. The project will be divided into three phases:

### Phase 1: Foundation & Prototype
- [Input from User]: Collect public financial data of a company (last 5–10 years etc).
- Analyze the data (Learn about the company).
    - What it does
    - What are its products/services
    - What it did
    - Where it invested and how it performed (earnings, dividends, losses etc).
    - Key financial metrics (revenue, profit, growth rate).
- Provide a summary of the company's financial health.

### Phase 2: Real-Time Analysis and Prediction
- Fetch real-time market data using APIs (Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage).
- Predict the current value of company on historical data and compare it with the company actual value. (The difference is the prediction error)[This is the point where we have to improve and focus ⭐].
- Show the ranking of the company in the market based on its current value and prediction error.
- Competitor in the market and their ranking.
- Provide insights on what could have been done better to improve the company's value (like where it could have went wrong or whatt could have been better decision).

### Phase 3: Future Planning and Strategy
- [Input from User]: What are the future plans of the company?
- Combine past knowledge(previous financial health summary from phase_1, current market value and also looking at competitors and insights from phase_2) with the company's future plans with the current market conditions and predict the future value of the company.
- Provide a detailed report on the company's future value based on its plans and market conditions.(Suggest strategic moves based on predictive insights and tell what to do.)
