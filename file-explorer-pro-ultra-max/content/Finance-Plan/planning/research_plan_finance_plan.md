# Research Plan: Finance-Plan Tech Stack

## Objectives
- Provide a comprehensive technology stack recommendation for the Finance-Plan project.
- Cover all 11 success criteria outlined in the user's request.
- Focus on current (2024-2025) and well-supported technologies.

## Research Breakdown
- **Phase 1: Foundational Research (Broad Strokes)**
    - Search for "modern tech stack for financial analysis platform 2024"
    - Search for "best open source financial analysis projects github"
- **Phase 2: Deep Dive into Specific Areas (Targeted Queries)**
    - **Backend:** "python vs node.js for financial data processing", "best python libraries for financial analysis"
    - **Frontend:** "react vs vue vs angular for financial dashboards", "best charting libraries for financial data"
    - **Data Science:** "best machine learning libraries for stock prediction", "pre-trained models for financial sentiment analysis"
    - **Databases:** "best time-series databases for financial data", "timescaledb vs influxdb for finance"
    - **APIs:** "best financial data apis 2024", "alpha vantage vs polygon.io vs iex cloud"
    - **Deployment & Security:** "deploying financial applications securely", "aws vs gcp for financial tech"
- **Phase 3: Data and Model Sourcing**
    - Search for "high-quality financial datasets for machine learning"
    - Search for "pre-trained financial language models"

## Key Questions
1.  What are the industry-standard technologies for each layer of a modern financial analysis platform?
2.  What are the pros and cons of different options within each technology category?
3.  What are the best practices for security and scalability in financial applications?
4.  What are some successful open-source examples that can serve as a reference?
5.  What are the most reputable sources for financial data and pre-trained models?

## Resource Strategy
- **Primary data sources:** Web search (`batch_web_search`). I will prioritize articles, blog posts, and documentation from reputable sources (e.g., major tech companies, financial technology publications, popular open-source projects).
- **Search strategies:** I will use a combination of broad and specific search queries to gather both high-level and detailed information. I will also use date-restricted searches to focus on recent information.

## Verification Plan
- **Source requirements:** I will cross-reference information from at least 3-5 independent sources to ensure accuracy and identify any consensus or conflicting opinions.
- **Cross-validation:** I will compare the features and capabilities of different technologies to validate their suitability for the Finance-Plan project.

## Expected Deliverables
- A final markdown report named `tech_stack_recommendation_finance_plan.md` that provides a comprehensive and well-structured answer to the user's request. The report will be organized according to the 11 success criteria and 10 research scope items.

## Workflow Selection
- **Primary focus:** Search
- **Justification:** The core of this task is to gather and synthesize information from the web. The verification will be done as part of the research process.
