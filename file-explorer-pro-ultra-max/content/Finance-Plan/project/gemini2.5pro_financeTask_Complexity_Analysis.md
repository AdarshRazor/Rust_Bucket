Excellent. Analyzing task complexity is a crucial step for project planning, resource allocation, and identifying potential risks. Here is the complexity analysis of the PRD tasks, followed by the detailed expansion files for the most complex items.

I will use a scoring system from 1 to 10:
*   **Low Complexity (1-3):** A straightforward, well-defined task using standard tools.
*   **Medium Complexity (4-6):** Requires integration of multiple components or contains some ambiguity that needs to be solved.
*   **High Complexity (7-10):** A core feature that requires research, significant algorithmic design, or complex system integration. These are candidates for expansion.

## Complexity Analysis of PRD Tasks

| Task Title (from TODO) | Complexity Score (1-10) | Expansion Command | Reasoning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 0: Setup** | | | |
| T0.4: Setup Databases | 4 | | Requires Docker Compose configuration, networking between containers, and understanding of TimeScaleDB/Redis setup. |
| T0.5: Define initial database schema | 4 | | Requires foresight into time-series data, indexing for performance, and how different financial statements will link. |
| T0.6: Establish CI/CD pipeline | 5 | | Setting up YAML workflows, secrets management, and deployment scripts is moderately complex for a full-stack app. |
| **Phase 1: Foundation** | | | |
| T1.2: Store fetched historical data | 5 | | Involves data cleaning, handling missing values, and writing efficient batch inserts into TimeScaleDB to avoid performance issues. |
| T1.7: Integrate `react-financial-charts` | 5 | | Charting libraries often require specific data formats and handling user interactions, which can be moderately complex. |
| T1.10: Automated Health Summary | 7 | `EXPAND(Automated_Health_Summary_Engine)` | Going beyond simple "if-then" requires a rule engine and natural language generation, making it a complex logical task. |
| T1.11: Deploy a live v1 prototype | 6 | | The first full deployment is always challenging, involving environment variables, CORS, database connectivity, and build processes. |
| **Phase 2: Real-Time & Prediction** | | | |
| T2.6: ML Model Training Script | 8 | `EXPAND(Predictive_Valuation_Model)` | This is the core ML task. It involves deep knowledge of feature engineering, model selection, training, and validation for time-series data. |
| T2.10: Develop logic to identify competitors | 6 | | While APIs provide peers, selecting the *most relevant* competitors and handling edge cases requires non-trivial logic. |
| T2.13: Strategic Retrospective Insights | 9 | `EXPAND(Strategic_Retrospective_Insights_Engine)` | Highly complex. Requires correlating model predictions with unstructured data (news), analyzing sentiment (FinBERT), and building a causality engine. This is a research-heavy task. |
| **Phase 3: Future Planning** | | | |
| T3.3: Enhance Prediction Model | 8 | `EXPAND(Future_Scenario_Modeling_Enhancement)` | Translating qualitative user plans into quantitative model inputs is a significant data science and modeling challenge. |
| T3.4: Develop logic to project future value | 7 | | This builds on T3.3 and involves running multiple simulations, defining scenario parameters (best/worst case), and aggregating results into a coherent forecast. |
| T3.6: Develop a report generation module | 6 | | Creating well-formatted, data-rich reports (especially PDFs) programmatically can be tedious and complex due to layout/styling constraints. |
