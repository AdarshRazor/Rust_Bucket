## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A subdued teal (#45A29E) to create a sense of professionalism and calm in handling documents.
- Background color: A very light off-white (#F0F8FF) to provide a clean, distraction-free reading environment.
- Accent color: A warm salmon (#FA8072) for interactive elements like links and buttons, adding a touch of warmth and approachability.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif known for its clean, modern appearance and excellent readability.
- Simple, monochrome icons for file types (markdown, PDF) and actions (download, open). Use feather icons or a similar lightweight library.
- Sidebar navigation on the left with a clear separation between file list and content display on the right. Use a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes.
- Subtle transitions when switching between files or opening/closing the sidebar. Keep animations short and functional to avoid distracting the user.
