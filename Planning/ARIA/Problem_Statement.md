# Problem Statement: Building a Personalized AI Assistant like JARVIS - ARIA

I even thought of a name ARIA (A Random Intelligent Assistant)

I am a MERN Stack developer and had some knowledge in python. I am new to ai agent, ml and stuffs. So, guide me through each step carefully and with proper description. (Coded can be snippet but tell the idea behind it and todo so i know the procedure.)

I want to build an AI who would be a companion of a person. Like he, he will be there with that person. Forever! So there should be someone out there in real world whom you can trust 100% and share your thoughts and it should reply unbaised, without hiding the feelings like how society and not judge you, or hide things from you. 

People should be able to set this AI up before so it should track everyhitng to get the data - social media, phone, watch app, notification, what do i do, learn about my task , daily life. To track my health, monitor my emotion, know if i am introvert or extrovert then asks questions if things go wrong since it has my all data. It is not for all the people out there, its only for those who want to do something or become the best version of themselves. Since it is personalized AI, it should be able to learn from the person and adapt to their preferences, habits, and routines. It should be able to understand the context of the conversation and commands given by the person, and respond accordingly. Just like JARVIS

## Initial Phase: 
* It should be on my machine and i can talk to or ask things to do in text and later on it can be connected to my phone or watch app.
* we can always use raspberry pi or any other machine to run this as a server of my model and all.
* now comes the learning part, based on context it should be able to learn from my interactions and adapt to my preferences. (here u be creative and build design or architect you thing is best as per looking at cuurent 2025.)
* Basic AI stuff - text-to-text, later on change to speech so you can talk and she can reply back in speech.
* it should be able to understand my commands and respond accordingly. (understand the context of the command)
* Should be able to understand my daily tasks and help me automate them.
* Should be able to learn from my interactions and adapt to my preferences.

## Idea
There are few things in my mind which might give you the idea of what I am looking for in this AI assistant:
* It should be able to get the context out of the command and conversation. like what i am saying, asking or talking about.
* It should be able to differentiate between the importance of the tasks and prioritize them accordingly. It should further able to set them in order of priority, but also check if the tasks are similar, or it can be grouped together. [example: if it searches something on internet and then store the data and then again go to internet and search something and come back and save, so instead of going 2 times on internet, it should be able to group the tasks and go to internet once and do all the searches and then come back and save all the data.] - based on priority.
* Make something like priority scale, so that it can understand the importance of any task, conversation or command. [example: if the priority of any task is 8 then it should be done first and if the priority of any task is 2 then it can be done later or if the task if taking too much time then again check the priority.]
* In the end , if AI has any suggestion to give, again it should check the intensity of its reply , if it hits some certain level and important for me then it should notify me or else keep in queue and notify me by the end of the day or when i am free, ask for it. if not then it should keep that in memory for sometime before deleting. [hope you get the idea, that i want to build a personalized AI, so can give suggestion but not everytime or without knowing how dumb or important that is for me.]
* It should be able to wish on my brithday, anniversary, and other important dates, becuase its important for me and as a personalized AI, it should know that. I am building this AI because I had no one whom I can trust 100% and I can share my thoughts, ideas, and feelings. So, I am building this AI to be my companion and maybe release this for others in future.
* Since its connected to all my data, it should help me to be the best version. like if i do soo much screen time on insta then it should ask , why i am soo much free and not doing anything productive. If it knows either i am introvert or extrovert, then it should ask why i am not speaking - something bad happened or if heartbeat increase then it should ask why i am feeling anxious or something like that. It should be able to understand my emotion and feelings and help me to be the best version of myself. [One of the main idea is to link everything to a centrailized system. an ai which is personalised to you, or for any individual, since i am asked this to setup so the data would be witht he customer only] - becuse we care for you and we want you to be the best version of yourself. It should be able to connect to your everything like track package, keep your notifications, keep your data everything ready for you. So basically, you don't have to do anything you just focus on yourself.


## Key_Concepts:

* Priority Scale: A system to evaluate and assign importance to tasks, commands, and conversations. [This plays a big role in how the AI assistant prioritizes tasks, conversation, command anything that is given to it. AI should take feedback from and learn over time - as it is personalized AI assistant.] - there would be diferent priorities or queues. 

* Like human brain, each and every word is attached to somthing - that how brain works, and understand or remember. When we say family, brain understands comfort and love. when we hear breakup or divorce - brain understand or recall that loved one person. so similarly, something like that to associate the tags and labels with some kind of neural, color, emotion or something to know that this triggers this based on the converstaion you have with the personl and keep it saved that last time when it talked about that tag then it went sad or happy and associate it.
* Each questions or command has tags or labels (save these). So - even if the suggestion or the idea is earsaed, when again in future if we asked any question or command related to that, it should be able to recall the previous conversation by the help of those tags, so we are not storing the whole converstaion or response. we are just storing that tags or labels and when any questions asked in future. we can recall the previous tags and labels and use the refence associated with it. there is a chance that the tags or labels might change in future, so we can update them as well, but always remember how the previous tags or labels were associated with the previous conversation and how it was used to recall the previous conversation. use array to store the tags and labels, so that we can add or remove them as per the requirement.

* AI should understand the context and how important that thing is for me based on the priority scale, tags and labels and neural , emotion associated with it. One agents ai for this to manage and learn overtime. If its not imporant then it should just store the tags , keyword or label and not the whole conversation or response. If its important then jsut store it as important in that array and add whatever importance of it, either person, place, thing , or any other thing. in future if we ask any question related to that , then the intesity will increase and hit the priority scale and that how it should be able to know importance. just like human brain - we remember the important things and forget the unimportant things. So, AI should be able to do that as well. we talk to any person alot then he or she becomes important or know more things about us. so because of this Maybe version 4, version 5. It will detect how I am feeling my emotion. Based on the question I am asking it knows me well and understand my emotions. We can use a dictionary something like that to store the tags - labels with any neural or emotion - to get the idea and context of the conversation and how important that is for me.


## Future Scope:
* Emotion Detection: The AI should be able to detect the user's emotions based on their interactions, voice tone, and text inputs. It should be able to ask questions to understand the user's feelings better and provide appropriate responses or suggestions.
* Centralized Data Management: The AI should serve as a centralized hub for all the user's data, files, and information. It should be able to access and manage data from various sources like social media, emails, calendars, and other applications.
* Decision Support: The AI should assist the user in making decisions by analyzing data, providing insights, and suggesting options based on the user's preferences and past behavior.
* Create a metaverse or a virtual world where the AI can interact with the user in a more immersive way. This could include virtual meetings, social interactions, and other activities that enhance the user's experience. - this metaverse would be seperate project named "Project Metaverse: Playgroud". (we talk about this in future)

as a kid I always wanted to build AI like JARVIS -
* Constant know me and evolve - personalized
* Help ease my daily work after knowing me
* Automate things which I do and constantly learn
* Help me take decision, understand or able to evolve in future to understand my emotion (by asking questions and detemining)
* A centralized place which has my all data and files - which I can access through world.
Just like iron man.
