# Project Requirements and Guidelines

ARIA aims to be a trusted, unbiased companion that evolves with you, leveraging your data to enhance your life. Here are the requirements and guidelines, enriched with creative ideas and future scope based on 2025 trends:

## Core Requirements
1. **Data Integration**: Collect data from social media (e.g., Twitter API v2), phone (Android/iOS APIs), wearables (Fitbit/Google Fit), notifications, and daily activities to understand your habits, preferences, and emotions.
2. **Privacy and Security**: Encrypt data end-to-end (AES-256), store it locally or on a user-controlled private cloud (e.g., Nextcloud), and provide opt-in/opt-out controls.
3. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Use state-of-the-art models (e.g., LLaMA 3 or GPT-4o mini) for contextual understanding of text commands, with plans for speech integration (Whisper API).
4. **Task Prioritization**: Implement a dynamic priority scale (1-10) based on urgency, importance, and user feedback, with task grouping for efficiency.
5. **Emotion Detection**: Analyze text sentiment (VADER or fine-tuned BERT), voice tone (future scope with Librosa), and physiological data (e.g., heart rate from wearables) to gauge emotions.
6. **Centralized Data Hub**: Create a unified system to manage files, notifications, and personal data, accessible via a RESTful API or local interface.
7. **Decision Support**: Offer insights and suggestions using machine learning (e.g., reinforcement learning for personalization) based on your behavior and goals.
8. **Learning and Adaptation**: Employ continual learning (e.g., online learning with PyTorch) to adapt to your evolving preferences over time.
9. **Scalability**: Design for growth with microservices architecture (Docker, Kubernetes) and edge computing for low-latency on-device processing.

## Creative Additions
- **Mood-Based Responses**: Adjust tone and suggestions based on detected emotions (e.g., upbeat for happiness, calming for stress).
- **Gamification**: Reward progress toward goals (e.g., reducing screen time) with badges or motivational messages.
- **Proactive Check-ins**: If ARIA detects anomalies (e.g., prolonged silence from an extrovert), it initiates a conversation.
- **Ethical AI**: Ensure transparency by explaining why suggestions are made (e.g., "I suggest this because youâ€™ve been stressed lately").

## Future Scope
- **Voice Interaction**: Integrate speech-to-text (Whisper) and text-to-speech (ElevenLabs) for hands-free use.
- **Metaverse Integration**: Develop "Project Metaverse: Playground" for immersive interactions (Unity + Oculus SDK).
- **Health Insights**: Use wearable data for real-time health monitoring (e.g., sleep patterns, stress levels).
- **Global Deployment**: Open-source ARIA with a freemium model, targeting self-improvement enthusiasts.
