# Detailed Implementation Guide

## Phase 1: Basic Chatbot (Weeks 1-2)
- **Goal**: Build a text-based assistant that understands commands.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Install Python 3.11 and Rasa**:
     - Use `pip install rasa` to install the Rasa framework.
     - Run `rasa init` to create a new project directory with default files.
  2. **Train Rasa on a small dataset**:
     - Define intents in `nlu.yml`, such as "greet" or "set_task".
     - Create sample conversations in `stories.yml`.
     - Execute `rasa train` to train the model.
  3. **Test basic interactions**:
     - Use `rasa shell` to interact with the chatbot via the terminal.

## Phase 2: Data Collection (Weeks 3-4)
- **Goal**: Integrate ARIA with your digital ecosystem.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Use Twitter API v2 for social media data**:
     - Obtain API keys from developer.twitter.com.
     - Use `tweepy` to fetch tweets: `client.get_users_tweets()`.
  2. **Leverage Android Debug Bridge (ADB) for phone data**:
     - Use `adb shell dumpsys notification` to retrieve notifications.
     - Collect screen time data using ADB commands.
  3. **Store raw data in MongoDB with encryption**:
     - Use `pymongo` to insert data: `db.collection.insert_one()`.
     - Encrypt sensitive data using `cryptography` library.

## Phase 3: Task Prioritization (Weeks 5-6)
- **Goal**: Enable ARIA to manage and prioritize tasks.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Define a priority scale (1-10)**:
     - Assign scores based on urgency and importance (e.g., deadlines add +3).
  2. **Write Python logic to group similar tasks**:
     - Use lists to batch tasks: `if task.type == "search": batch.append(task)`.
  3. **Test with sample tasks from your routine**:
     - Create mock tasks and verify prioritization and grouping.

## Phase 4: Emotion Detection (Weeks 7-8)
- **Goal**: Detect basic emotions from text inputs.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Use Hugging Faceâ€™s sentiment analysis model**:
     - Load a pre-trained model like DistilBERT: `pipeline("sentiment-analysis")`.
  2. **Fine-tune on a labeled dataset**:
     - Use your journal entries from me-3m.md to create positive/negative labels.
  3. **Integrate with Rasa**:
     - Adjust responses based on detected sentiment (e.g., if negative, ask "Are you okay?").

## Phase 5: Centralized Data Hub (Weeks 9-10)
- **Goal**: Create a single point for all your data.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Set up Flask RESTful APIs**:
     - Define endpoints for data CRUD operations (e.g., `/data` with GET/POST).
  2. **Link APIs to MongoDB**:
     - Use `pymongo` to interact with the database.
     - Implement secure endpoints with JWT tokens.
  3. **Test data retrieval**:
     - Fetch recent notifications or tasks via API calls.

## Phase 6: Decision Support (Weeks 11-12)
- **Goal**: Provide basic suggestions based on data.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Analyze patterns**:
     - Check for high screen time and suggest productivity breaks.
  2. **Use rules-based logic for suggestions**:
     - If screen time > 5 hours, suggest "Take a break".
  3. **Test with your goals**:
     - Validate suggestions align with personal goals (e.g., reduce substance use).

## Phase 7: Optimization and Testing (Weeks 13-14)
- **Goal**: Refine ARIA for daily use.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Optimize Rasa model**:
     - Use model quantization for faster responses.
  2. **Deploy on Raspberry Pi**:
     - Run the application locally: `python app.py`.
  3. **Iterate based on feedback**:
     - Test with daily tasks and refine features accordingly.
