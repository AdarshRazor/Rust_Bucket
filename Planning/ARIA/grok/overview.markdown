# Project Overview

ARIA is a personalized AI companion designed to support your journey toward becoming the best version of yourself, inspired by your dream of a JARVIS-like assistant. It will:
- Start as a text-based chatbot, evolving into a voice-enabled, emotion-aware system.
- Integrate with your digital life to automate tasks, manage data, and provide insights.
- Prioritize privacy, keeping your data under your control.
- Scale from a solo project to a potential product for others, aligning with your entrepreneurial goals from the life audit.

In 2025, with tools like PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers, and affordable edge devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi 5), ARIA can be built incrementally at home, leveraging cloud resources (AWS Free Tier) for heavy lifting.
