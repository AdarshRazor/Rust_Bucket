Briefing Document: Roadmap to HFT and Hedge Funds

This briefing document summarizes the key themes and advice provided in the video "Roadmap to HFT and Hedge funds | Quant Trader | SDE," which offers guidance to college students aiming for internships or jobs in High-Frequency Trading (HFT) firms and hedge funds.

Overall Theme: The video provides a structured roadmap for aspiring candidates, outlining the necessary technical skills, academic focus, project ideas, and timeline to maximize their chances of securing a position in the competitive HFT and hedge fund industry. It emphasizes the importance of mastering core computer science concepts, mathematics, and C++ programming, while also highlighting the value of competitive programming achievements.

Key Themes and Ideas:

    Industry Overview and Firm Types: While not extensively covered in the video due to prior content, the speaker briefly mentions that both HFT firms and hedge funds hire freshers for various locations including India, Europe, Singapore, USA, and Hong Kong. Specific firms like D. Shaw and Tower Research Capital are mentioned as examples, having hired the speaker.
    Team Structures and Roles: HFTs and hedge funds typically have distinct divisions, with the video focusing on two key areas for engineering students:

    Trading Division:Portfolio Managers: The highest-paid individuals, responsible for investment decisions and strategy implementation. This is a role for experienced professionals, not freshers.
    Traders and Strategists: Responsible for finding "Alpha" (excess return on investment) and building trading strategies. Freshers are hired for these roles. "If your sole responsibility in The Firm is actually to find the alpha and you do not find that so you could very easily get fired as well." However, successfully finding Alpha leads to significant financial rewards, potentially including a cut of the profits.
    Engineering Teams (within Trading): Includes Software Development Engineers (SDEs) with roles like Low Latency Developer and Quantitative Developer. Their focus is often on optimizing existing trading infrastructure. These are also well-compensated roles for freshers.
    Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) / Python Developers: Responsible for building and maintaining monitoring infrastructure for production systems. While not as development-focused as other engineering roles, it is an interesting role for which freshers are hired. Their work often involves significant Python coding.
    Engineering Division:Software Development Engineers (SDEs): These engineers build the core trading infrastructure, including trade servers and implementations of exchange protocols. They focus on building "ultra low latency systems" with response times in microseconds or nanoseconds. Deep knowledge of core computer science is essential for these roles.
    Quality Assurance (QA) Teams: Responsible for testing the software developed by SDEs. QA in this industry involves significant coding for automated testing.
    Site Reliability Engineers (SREs): Similar responsibilities to SREs in the trading division, focusing on infrastructure monitoring and reliability.

    Importance of Core Computer Science Subjects: The video strongly emphasizes the need to master fundamental computer science subjects for success in interviews and the role itself. These include:

    Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA): Crucial for interviews and problem-solving. Should be prioritized early in college.
    Operating Systems (OS)
    Computer Architecture
    Computer Networks
    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Specifically focusing on C++.

    Mathematics as a Key Skill: Mathematics, particularly probability, statistics, permutation and combination, trigonometry, and calculus, is highlighted as critical. The speaker advises practicing these topics early in college while they are still fresh from high school preparation.
    C++ as the Dominant Language: C++ is presented as the primary programming language used by HFTs and hedge funds. The speaker strongly recommends practicing DSA and doing projects in C++ to build proficiency. Learning advanced C++ concepts (C++17 and beyond, including C++20) is crucial for placement interviews. Python is mentioned as the second most important language, particularly for SRE roles and potentially machine learning projects.
    Competitive Programming and Achievements: Participating in and excelling in competitive programming contests like ACM ICPC is highly recommended. Good rankings and achievements in these contests are seen as significant differentiators and "make a massive impact" on a candidate's profile in this industry.
    Project Ideas for Profile Building: The video suggests undertaking challenging projects, ideally in C++, to demonstrate design and coding skills. Simply copying code from GitHub is strongly discouraged. Suggested project ideas include:

    Building a load balancer in C++
    Implementing the TCP protocol in C++
    Implementing a distributed rate limiter in C++
    Implementing exchange protocols like FIX (Financial Information eXchange) or NASDAQ OUCH.
    Machine learning projects (can be done in Python if C++ is not feasible).

    College Year Breakdown and Focus: The video provides a suggested timeline for college students:

    First Year: Focus heavily on Data Structures and Algorithms, competitive coding contests, and mathematics (probability, statistics, permutation and combination, trigonometry, calculus). Practice DSA in C++.
    Second Year: Focus on core computer science subjects (OS, Computer Architecture, Computer Networks, OOP, especially in C++). Continue competitive coding and solving difficult math problems. Start doing projects in C++ or Python. Learn Machine Learning if time permits.
    Third Year: Time for internship interviews. Continue working on challenging projects in C++ to improve design and coding skills. Continue competitive programming and learning advanced C++. Revise core computer science and mathematics. Learn Machine Learning if not done in the second year.
    Fourth Year: Time for placement interviews. Continue practicing interview questions, revising core subjects and mathematics, and potentially working on projects. Even if placement is not secured, gaining work experience and continuing to practice will be beneficial for future attempts.

    Learning from the Best and Resource Recommendations: The speaker advises learning from experienced individuals in the industry rather than relying solely on coaching institutes or general online content. While not detailing specific resources within this video, the speaker refers to other videos they have made which contain recommendations for practicing mathematics, interview experiences, core computer science subjects, and advanced C++.

Important Facts and Advice:

    A fresher cannot become a portfolio manager.
    Finding Alpha is difficult but highly rewarding, potentially leading to a profit cut.
    Freshers are hired for Trader/Strategist, Low Latency Dev, Quant Dev, and SRE roles.
    C++ is the most heavily used language, followed by Python.
    Mastering core computer science and mathematics is non-negotiable.
    Competitive programming achievements are a significant advantage.
    Challenging projects demonstrating design and coding skills are crucial for the resume.
    Don't wait for college curriculum; proactively learn core subjects if they are taught later.
    Placement in HFTs is highly competitive, but failure doesn't mean the end of opportunities; gaining work experience can also lead to entry.
    Free online resources are available and sufficient for preparation.

In conclusion, the video offers a clear and actionable plan for college students to prepare for a career in HFT and hedge funds. It stresses the importance of a strong technical foundation, consistent practice, strategic project work, and leveraging academic and competitive programming achievements. The emphasis on C++ and core computer science reflects the demanding technical nature of these roles.
