 # AI-Diagnosis Telemedicine appointment Scheduler
* chatbot where patient can interact.
* Patients submit symptoms and images; back-end runs an ML model for preliminary diagnosis and then routes to specialists.
* Allowing patients to book video calls with doctors, integrated with calendaring APIs (eg.Google Calendar) and WebRTC-based video chat

This would be divided into 2 parts -

### 1st Part (AI Diagnosis)
* Use chat or AI bot to talk with the person, allow them to upload images and ask few questions [use HIPPA style compliance]
* allow the AI to ask multiple question in order to get more details
* use ML and AI to diagnose the symptoms and give the result based on accuracy. [accuracy percentage should be correct. If the AI is not sure then tell in form of number]
* Use the user location to track and provide the details based on the result and the specialist around user based on the diagnosis to consult with.

### 2nd Part (Appointment Scheduler)
* After finding the specialist around the user, allow them to book video call or voice call with doctors or the provided number. [Using Video call, whatsapp, voice over call whichever is available] - WebRTC-based video chat or any API
* Integrated with Google Calendar to save the appointment for the user.


I want to build Mobile App. I have few experience while building the desktop apps (NEXTJS(Frontend and Backend-API Creation), Typescript, Tailwind, Clerk[user auth], Supabase[DB and Storage]).

Do compare the best and scalable and easy tech stack by keeping modern technologies and reduced the work load. Try to use, already build API or model or any thing which would increase my work 4x.
